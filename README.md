shell draws text to the display using the openvg graphics layer (...also EGL?)

drawing requires the ukai.ttf file to be copied to RAM

ukai.ttf: Something went really wrong, and we can’t process that file.

drawchar.h will run the pinyin command to translate pinyin to unicode

shell uses the freetype library to convert glyphs to paths: requires ft2build.h

users runs shell in a multi-user environment

frame calls users to call shell which creates an image for frame to return

streamframe.html calls streamframe, which eats frames generated by shell

use streamframe to run shell without users. todo: output redirects, noframewait
